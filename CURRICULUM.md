## üîß Prerequisites  
- Intermediate Python (functions, data structures, NumPy, Pandas)  
- Familiarity with Git and the command line  
- Some knowledge of Docker and cloud tools is helpful, not required  

---

## üéØ Course Objectives  
By completing this course, you will be able to:
- Implement and evaluate baseline ML models using scikit-learn  
- Simulate adversarial attacks like data poisoning and prompt injection  
- Explore the attack surface of modern LLMs  
- Log experiments and analysis in a reproducible format
